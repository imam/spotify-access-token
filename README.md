Getting the access token as easy as:
1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're using yarn) in the directory
3. `node .`, the application should be running on `localhost:8000` by default
4. Create a new application on Spotify developer ([developer.spotify.com](http://developer.spotify.com))
5. Copy the client id and secret to the cloned application and submit
6. Redirect to homepage
7. You can either copy the access token from `localhost:8000\token` directly to your React application, or make an ajax call from the React application to the cloned application.
8. Profit
